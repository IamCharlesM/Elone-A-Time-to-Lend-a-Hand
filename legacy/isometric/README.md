Elone: A Time to Lend a Hand
===================

It's late in the evening, you're called to the scene of an apparent suicide, the victim is in a locked room, with a gun in one hand, and a hole where their eye used to be. Your job is to figure out if this was actually someone who could no longer stand being in this world, or, was it someone else who didn't *want* them to be here?
